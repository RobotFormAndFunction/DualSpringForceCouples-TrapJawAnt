# Dual Spring Force Couple in Trap Jaw Ant

Dynamic models for the dual spring force couple model of trap jaw ants associated with the Journal of Experimental Biology publication entitled "Dual spring force couples yield multifunctionality and ultrafast, precision rotation in tiny biomechanical systems". doi:10.1242/jeb.244077

The mandible_model.m file is the dynamic model of one mandible, while the morphospace_search.m file searches over large configuration spaces.
